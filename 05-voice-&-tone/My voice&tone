# Voice & Tone



## Voice

My name as a brand should give a serious but lightweight impression. Seriousness for the sake of mutual respect and esteem, but this relationship should be lightweight. We don't have to play king of the world because if it's not about life, it's not about anything. I would like my brand to be seen as a serious partner that does a good job but is fun to work with.

1. Professional
2. Friendly
3. Easy and clear

## Tone

Whatever the job, my tone is more of a professional form. It should be treated with respect and deference. As when someone comes to me, they should assume that I have some experience and know something about the industry. After we respect each other, I myself lean towards a more friendly form of communication. It's more pleasant to work in a friendly environment. than if we focus on how annoyed we are instead of working.

- Relaxed
- Kind
- Respectful

## Style

My style is to walk the client through the whole process, tell them where certain issues will be and what all will be happening. It is a style where both parties find out where they stand and what they can expect from each other. They act together with respect and dignity to achieve a common goal. It's important to understand each other and work out the best possible solution to the task at hand. 

- Helpful
- Willingness
- hardworking
