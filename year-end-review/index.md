# Year End Review

1) What did you like most about this course?

The fun format of the class, the friendly and motivating environment, and showing another way to think about design and assignments.

2) What did you like least about this course?

Probably the fact that we spent more time on some things than we should have.

3) What were the top (three) things you learned this year?

- Not to be afraid of speaking English

4) What was the most memorable activity/assignment?

Overall presentations, how to prepare them what structure they should have and so on.

5) What’s something you accomplished this year that you are most proud of?

Finishing my undergraduate thesis, of course. And also asserting my position at work.

6) What’s one thing you learned about yourself?

That I can do a good job when I want to and I put in the time.

7) What’s one thing you could have done better?

There is always something better to do, so I can't think of any one thing in particular. But if I went back to anything I did today, I'm sure I'd say I could have done something better.

8) What’s one thing I could have done better?

That's a tough question, but for me I can't think of one thing you could have improved on because the classes were great, educational, fun and most importantly positive.

9) What’s one thing you would add or change about this course?

I would add more in-class work and follow-up discussion of what we created in that class.

10) What advice would you give to students taking this course next year?

Keep them calm and do the homework because they can learn a lot of new useful things and move on because of it.
