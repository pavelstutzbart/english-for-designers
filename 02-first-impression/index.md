I'm Paul, student of Graphic and media design, I come from a printing family, my great-grandfather was already a letterpress printer, but now my family focuses on screen printing. I like simple design and I'm a believer that the little things make the whole. I like to explore new methods of design. I believe you will like my work and we will agree to work together. What I've done so far: Logos | Brand's identity | Original Icons | Typography | Posters | Vector Graphic

I love being a designer as I can bring my creative ideas to life.
