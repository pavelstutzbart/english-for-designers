# Theatre Viola

New identity for theatre Viola. The project includes new logo, new identity and communication on social media including the website. It is a solution to the problem of disjointed visual identity. This problem had already arisen in history, so the current management of the theatre decided to correct it. This process is still ongoing and it is not easy to achieve the desired result, but little by little the theatre is getting its coherent identity in the form of a new website, new communication on social media and coherent print materials and way-finding system.

### Solved problem
The project addresses the problem of a disjointed and outdated visual identity.
It moves theatre into the 21st century

### What I learned
Thinking about how to move the brand in the market, how to target a wider target group. And most importantly, how to negotiate and communicate with a real client.

### Duration
It took 2 months from assignment to competition presentation.
The implementation itself took 4 months.
