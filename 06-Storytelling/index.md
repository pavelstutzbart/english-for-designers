# My journey from a big agency to a small one

Hello, this is my storytelling about my journey from a big agency to a small one. I want to point out that this is my subjective view and may not be representative of everyone's experiences, as everyone has different preferences and circumstances.

It all started in June, when I was hired as an intern at a big agency for my first experience as a graphic designer at an agency. I was excited to go to work, like how I used to be excited to go to a water park as a child.

The first month was great. I was learning how everything worked, meeting new people, and doing interesting work. My supervisor cared about me and tried to help me progress.

However, there was one big problem. The next two months of my internship were awful. I felt like I was just a small part of a company with 80 other people. As my boss had told me at the beginning, if I didn't mess up, nobody would even notice me. Unfortunately, after a month, I did mess up. During those two months, I mostly did PowerPoint presentations or Google slides. The only bright spot was creating an Instagram profile for a brand. I had to sit there all day, even when there was nothing to do, and was being paid a ridiculous salary. I couldn't even celebrate the summer.

After three months, my internship ended. And after another two months, I finally found a job at a small agency. From the start, I felt better about it.

In this agency, there are only about 7 people in charge of interesting projects and clients. The great thing is that I am involved in the whole process from the beginning to the end. I can discuss my work with everyone on the team, and my boss tries to push me forward in my skills. Additionally, I have found friends here who I can have a beer with after work.
